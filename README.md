# IG repo
This is a repo containing the documents of developing a demo Implementation Guide (IG) with FHIR Shorthand (FSH).

o	An Implementation Guide (IG) in FHIR is a set of rules and guidelines for how to use FHIR in a specific context or use case. It can include a collection of FHIR resources, such as profiles, extensions, value sets, and examples that are specific to that context or use case.

o	FHIR profiles are one of the components that can be included in an Implementation Guide. A FHIR profile is a way to define how a specific resource or set of resources should be used in a particular context. It can include constraints on the allowed data elements, as well as extensions specific to that context.

o	So, an Implementation Guide is a collection of resources and guidelines for using FHIR in a specific context, and a FHIR profile is a part of that collection, it is a specific way of defining how a resource should be used in a particular context. An Implementation guide can include one or more profiles and many other resources to fully define how FHIR should be used in a specific context.
